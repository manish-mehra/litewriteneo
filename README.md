# LiteWriteNeo (Work in Progress)

LiteWriteNeo is a distraction-free writing app designed for simplicity and efficiency. It allows you to focus on your thoughts without any unnecessary distractions. LiteWriteNeo is aimed to be as a modernized version of the original [LiteWrite](https://github.com/litewrite/litewrite) project, built using vanilla JavaScript with TypeScript for enhanced performance and maintainability.

**Please note that LiteWriteNeo is currently a work in progress. It is actively being developed and may not yet be feature-complete or fully stable.**

## Features

- **Distraction-Free Interface:** Enjoy a clutter-free writing environment with a minimalist interface, allowing you to concentrate on your ideas.
- **Local Storage:** Your notes are stored locally using IndexedDB, ensuring that your data is saved securely on your device.
- **Sync Functionality (Deprecated):** In the original version, LiteWrite used remotestorage.js to sync changes locally and provided options for saving to remote storage, Google Drive, and Dropbox. However, due to restrictions and limitations, Google Drive integration is no longer available. Remote storage and Dropbox options have not been tested.
- **Familiar and Intuitive:** LiteWriteNeo retains the simplicity of the original LiteWrite app while incorporating modern technologies, making it easy to use and navigate.
